          While developing the NLP models that power our products is difficult, delivering that technology in a way that improves our client’s workday is equally challenging. The efficiency and happiness of our clients is dependent on our product being simple and reliable. We pride ourselves on design that delights not only the companies that purchase our products, but the people who actually use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a backend engineer you’ll work on resilient and fault tolerant infrastructure to deliver compute-intensive artificial intelligence applications. Our applications are critical for our customers to get their work done, so down-time is not an option. Combining aggressive uptime goals with the fact that the algorithms for automating real-time chat require lots of context and are therefore not trivial to distribute makes for interesting systems challenges. Navigating these challenges will be your day-to-day.
        </p>
        <p>
          No two days are the same for a backend engineer at Eloquent, but you can expect to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work on challenging distributed systems problems in Java, Python, and C</li>
          <li>Be a perfectionist about code quality, reliability and uptime</li>
          <li>Have a deep influence on the architecture and implementation of our systems</li>
          <li>Work on a very fast release cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We value our backend engineers when they ship code that does its job and almost never crashes.

          As a NLP research scientist you’ll be working on solving customer problems with novel approaches and algorithms. The focus of your problem-solving at Eloquent is on the product, not the algorithms. While you will do your fair share of hyperparameter tuning and architecture search, you will spend even more time on ensuring that you define your research problems in a way that will serve the product, and collecting the perfect training sets to ensure excellent real world performance. We’re not ideologically opposed to you using a rule-based system when that’s the best approach, and we love it when you shamelessly apply psychological tricks to the product instead of embarking on a big research project.
        </p>
        <p>No two days are the same for an NLP research scientist at Eloquent, but you can expect to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Interpret user feedback and participate in product design discussions</li>
          <li>Define creative research directions that will solve customer problems</li>
          <li>Collect and tune new datasets to support novel research</li>
          <li>Train state of the art models that ship to customers on a fast release cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We value our NLP research scientists when they come up with a creative way to *not* have to solve a research problem, and instead solve the problem with a product tweak.

          As an HCI research scientist you’ll be working on the hard human problems that crop up when deeply integrating algorithms into people’s workflow, and when deeply integrating people into algorithms. Our algorithms perform best when we have fast and accurate responses from people in the system whose input is requested. You’ll make huge contributions to the performance of the whole product when you discover new interface designs that optimize user behavior by even 10%. You’ll also work on tuning the workflow of people who use the product and call out to our algorithms for assistance. You’ll contribute lots of code, run user studies, and help make big product decisions.
